# Summary of Findings
There was a downward slope in the monthly sales growth from September to December. Upon discussion with the stakeholder, it was discovered that there was an upsurge in competition around that period which led to decrease in customers as well as sales. Also, Beans was the highest selling product that yielded more profit.
# Recommendations
* Focus on customer retention by offering incentives such as discounts to attract their interest
* Conduct customer survey and utilise feeback to improve sales performance
* Stock products that yeilded more profits and were higher in demands
